# Asistan
A  web app to minimize the spread of COVID – 19 around us . 
 The problem that Asistan solves :
Keeping in mind the safety of citizens against covid – 19 . we are here with our version of covid Assist web application which is customized to notify all the users about the spread of covid – 19 . 
The web app allows you to enter the locations that you have visited in past few days and If you turn out to be symptomatic to covid-19 or turns out to be covid -19 positive , it  will notify these locations to all the users so that they get aware about the spread and can self quarantine themselves if they had visited the same locations .
